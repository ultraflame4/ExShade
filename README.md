## Development

### Requirements.
All requirements are in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

`pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.

This is the main file to run for development.

watch.py is a script that watches for changes in the resourcepack 
and copies them to the minecraft resourcepack folder.

Edit the values in the file to match your setup.
